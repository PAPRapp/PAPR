# PAPR 

PAPR is an educational web trading application designed for newbies to trade on the financial markets. The applicaiton is geared towards teachers and students, where teachers can create a room with a particular set of companies for students to trade virtual money. On creation of the room a unique URL is generated which then teachers can send out to students to join the room automatically.

Inside the rooms live stock market data is used to render and update the bar charts, candle charts, and ticker information in real time. Additionally the platform provides news information and a sentement analysier which lets the students know if that article is a neutural, postive or negative article about that company. With all this information the students can make a informed buy or sell disession.

Each students portfolio is tracked and updated in real time against the current stock prices for each particular company. Each students total USD portfolio value is also displayed in a leader board in the room so that other students can compare there performance against other students in that room.
